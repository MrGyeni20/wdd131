        <h2>Glory Years and Who Made It Possible</h2>

        <article class="coach-card">
            <h3>Bill Shankly (December 1959 – July 1974)</h3>

            </figure>
            <p>When Bill Shankly arrived in late 1959, Liverpool was languishing in the Second Division. 
                Over fifteen years, his leadership transformed the club into a dominant force. 
                Shankly guided Liverpool to promotion in 1962, winning the Second Division. 
                He then secured three First Division titles in 1963‑64, 1965‑66, and 1972‑73. 
                His FA Cup triumphs came in 1964‑65 (Liverpool's first ever) and again in 1973‑74.
                In 1972‑73, Liverpool also captured the UEFA Cup under his guidance. 
                He added Charity Shields in 1964 (shared), 1965 (shared), and 1966.</p>

            <h3>Bob Paisley (July 1974 – May 1983)</h3>

            </figure>
            <p> Bob Paisley succeeded Shankly and swiftly became Liverpool’s most successful manager ever. Between 1976 and 1983, he led Liverpool to six First Division titles, delivering in 1975‑76, 1976‑77, 1978‑79, 1979‑80, 1981‑82, and 1982‑83. 
                Paisley guided the team to European glory with three European Cups in 1976‑77, 1977‑78, and 1980‑81, and they also won the UEFA Cup in 1976. 
                Liverpool claimed the UEFA Super Cup in 1977 and secured three League Cups and multiple Charity/Community Shields under his watch. 
                In his nine years, Paisley collected around 20 major trophies, cementing Liverpool’s golden era.</p>

            <p>Kenny Dalglish led Liverpool to three league titles (1986, 1988, 1990) and two FA Cups (1986, 1989), including a famous double in his first season as player-manager.
               He was a steadying force during the Hillsborough tragedy, earning immense respect beyond football. 
              In his second spell, he won the 2012 League Cup, reinforcing his legacy as one of Liverpool’s greatest ever coaches.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>Rafael Benítez was appointed manager ahead of the 2004‑05 season and orchestrated one of Liverpool’s most famous triumphs: the 2005 UEFA Champions League final in Istanbul, where Liverpool came back from 3–0 down to draw 3–3 and win on penalties. 
                In 2005, he added the UEFA Super Cup, and in 2006 he led Liverpool to an FA Cup victory, edging West Ham on penalties after a dramatic 3–3 draw. 
                Benítez’s era reestablished Liverpool as a European heavyweight, with Champions League, Super Cup, and FA Cup success in successive seasons.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>Jurgen Klopp arrived in October 2015, inheriting a tired side struggling for consistency. 
                His first trophy arrived in June 2019, when Liverpool lifted the UEFA Champions League, defeating Tottenham 2–0 in Madrid. 
                That victory was followed later in 2019 by two more global honours: the UEFA Super Cup, won on penalties against Chelsea, and the club’s first-ever FIFA Club World Cup, beating Flamengo in extra time. 
                In June 2020, Klopp ended a 30‑year wait for a league championship by guiding Liverpool to the Premier League title, finishing with 99 points and records for home wins and points margin. 
                In the 2021‑22 season, he led Liverpool to both the FA Cup and the Carabao League Cup, again defeating Chelsea in both finals via penalty shootouts. 
                He then secured the Community Shield in 2022. 
                His last trophy came in March 2024, when Liverpool claimed their 10th League Cup by beating Chelsea again in extra time.</p>
